## **What is the Education Freedom Program (EduFree)?**

The education freedom program is the idea that students should have the freedom to get the highest quality and most affordable education available to them.

More concretely, this means that students should be able to maintain their enrollment at an education institution as long as they take one course, while getting course credits at different schools across the country.

Consider this example:

I'm currently enrolled as a software engineering student at Western University. I should be able to take a calculus course from University of Alberta, my mathematics course from University of Waterloo and Economics from Carleton University, Linear algebra from Coursera and my Engineering design group project I can take at my home university at Western.

While doing this I can still benefit from all the advantages my home university, Western University has to offer. On Monday, I go to the campus gyms, I have my first experience of adulthood by moving out and staying in the campus dorms, I play on the varsity soccer team, play intramural volleyball.

Replace the above schools and programs with your program and your country. It doesn't matter, the idea is the same. Students should have the freedom to seek the most affordable education for the highest quality price.

## Why Would Students Want to Do This?

1. It's cheaper. Once students can pick and choose between courses offered in different universities. Schools will need to offer competitive pricing to attract students.

2. You get better education: No longer are you restricted to only learning from the professors at your university. Perhaps you want to learn about history of Rome but your University only offers history of Greece. Or maybe your school offers both, but there is a better professor at another university. As a student, you should have a right to go to whereer you can get the education you want.

## Why Would Universities Want to Do This?

### The First Universities to implement Education Freedom will have a first mover advantage
In January 2014, I was facing the most difficult decision of my life. I was picking what university to attend and my final two choices were Queen’s and Western University. Both schools had excellent programs and a great reputation. I’d visited both campuses and they were both beautiful. I could equally see myself having a good experience at both schools. I remember agonzing for weeks over the decision. To say they were evenly tied would be an understatement. The single thing that tipped me towards choosing Western was they had a dual degree Engineering and Business program, with the Ivey Business school. Meanwhile at Queen’s I had to choose between either doing Engineering or Queen’s Commerce (business), but I couldn’t do both. 

I remember thinking to myself, “wow, most students who go to Ivey, probably also considered going to Queen’s. I wonder how many top students chose Ivey because of Queen simply for the single reason that Ivey has the dual degree program?” Imagine, how much money in alumni donations Queen’s has missed out on, simply because of all the smart, driven students that wanted to go to Queen’s but chose not to because they didn’t offer them as much freedom.

The exact same thing will happen with Education Freedom. At first most schools will resist. But then very quickly some very smart schools will offer their students education Freedom and then we’re off to the races. When students are choosing between what schools to attend, just like I did a few years ago, the schools that offer Education Freedom will be at a massive advantage. Students will check to see if their school offers Education Freedom, the same way that students check to see if a potential school offers things like co-op, varsity sports, amenities. It will eventually become a requirement for all schools. The schools who will be last to adapt, will be at a massive disadvantage.

## What You Can do

Right now everything I’ve said today is just an idea,It's called the Education Freedom Program, merely because I needed to give it a name beyond just Education Freedom, so it’s easier to search on the internet, but it’s really just an idea. No one owns this idea, but we need to share it as wide and far as possible so we can get more people talking about this. 


#### Share this article With Two People (one student and one educator)  
  

So here’s all you need to do: Share this article or video with two people: one person who is a student and one person you know who is in the education industry, it can be a professor, an administrator, your student council president, anyone! Also send them the link to  [educationfreedomprogram.org](https://educationfreedomprogram.org/), it has a lot more details that I couldn’t get to in this essay and there’s a subreddit called  [r/EducationFreedom](https://www.reddit.com/r/EducationFreedom/)  we set up for people to discuss the ideas more.

#### If you work in Education, Bring this Up At Your Next Board or Staff Meeting

If you are in the education industry or work for the government, we need your help. I strongly encourage you to bring up this concept at your next staff or board meeting. If you can’t pass it at the school level, try passing it at the faculty level. If you want me to come and talk to your team about the details of how this could work email me ([tomiwa@educationfreedom.org](mailto:info@educationfreedom.org)).

#### If you’re a Student, ask Student Council to Bring this up at Next Board Meeting

If you are a student, email the head of your school or faculty’s student council and make sure it gets added to the agenda of your school’s next board meeting. Post about this on your school’s Facebook, Instagram and Twitter pages. People in student council and student government put great effort into making sure you vote for them and talk about all the great things they will do for students once elected. Tell them that now is the time to act, this is why people voted for them. This is one of the most important things they can do to help students.
