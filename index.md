# Education Freedom Program (EduFree)

## **What is the Education Freedom Program (EduFree)?**

The education freedom program is the idea that students should have the freedom to get the highest quality and most affordable education available to them.

More concretely, this means that students should be able to maintain their enrollment at an education institution as long as they take one course, while getting course credits at different schools across the country.

Consider this example:

I'm currently enrolled as a software engineering student at Western University. I should be able to take a calculus course from University of Alberta, my mathematics course from University of Waterloo and Economics from Carleton University, Linear algebra from Coursera and my Engineering design group project I can take at my home university at Western.

While doing this I can still benefit from all the advantages my home university, Western University has to offer. On Monday, I go to the campus gyms, I have my first experience of adulthood by moving out and staying in the campus dorms, I play on the varsity soccer team, play intramural volleyball.

Replace the above schools and programs with your program and your country. It doesn't matter, the idea is the same. Students should have the freedom to seek the most affordable education for the highest quality price.

## **Why Would Students Want to Do That?**

1. It's cheaper. Once students can pick and choose between courses offered in all universities

2. You get better education: No longer are you restricted to only learning from the professors at your university. Perhaps you want to learn about history of Rome but your University only offers history of Greece. Or maybe your school offers both, but there is a better professor at another university. As a student, you should have a right to go to whereer you can get the education you want.

## **Why Would Schools Want to Do This?**

To be honest, they might not. In fact, they might fight very hard against this. Schools have a monopoly on education credentialling and like most monopolies they fight hard to protect their monopoly. But I also believe that many educators and administrators genuinely want to do what is best for students. If you're an educator and you truly want what is best for students, giving students the freedom to choose where they get an education is best for the student

Schools might also want to do this because the data is very clear and the current business model for most universities is no longer financially viable. Universities are now facing a Blockbuster or Netflix moment, they can either try and double down and protect their past business model or embrace the new change.

For some universities, they will see an increase in business. If you're a professor at the University of Waterloo and your first year calculus professor is the best in the country, you no longer are limited to enrolling only the Waterloo students. You could open up enrollment to students across Canada.

This is only a threat to mediocre universities that don't offer students value. For great universities with great education, this is a fantastic opportunity for you.

## Reasons Why People Think This Won't Work

Like any idea that challenges the status quo, there are going to be many criticisms of this idea. I welcome all those criticisms because they help find the flaws and weaknesses in an idea and ultimately make the idea better, the same way heat softens then hardens iron. 

However, it's important to note that while some criticism are legitimet, some people simply "make up reasons why this won't work, because they simply don't want to do it. Nevertheless, I will assume good intent and adress some of the questions and criticisms.

### How do we know the other schools are proper educations?

The schools will already be licensed. If I'm taking calculus from Western or McGill, both of these schools are licensed, therefore the governement has alreday ensured that both of these schools are qualified to teach calculus.

## Tricks Schools Might Play

Like mentioned earlier. While most educators are earnest, some schools will try and play various tricks to make it as difficult as possible for you to get the best education possible. Right now, schools have all the leverage so I'm actually not sure what can be done to prevent this. If you have any ideas, please let me know! (Post it on our reddit page, email me or tweet me). Currently, my plan is that if we can at least predict what they might try to do and raise awareness about it, they are less likely to try these tricks or at least, it's less likely to work.

## What You Can do

Right now everything I’ve said today is just an idea,It's called the Education Freedom Program, merely because I needed to give it a name beyond just Education Freedom, so it’s easier to search on the internet, but it’s really just an idea. No one owns this idea, but we need to share it as wide and far as possible so we can get more people talking about this. So here’s all you need to do: Share this article or video with two people: one person who is a student and one person you know who is in the education industry, it can be your professor, an administrator. You can also send them the link to educationfreedomprogram.org and the subreddit we set up for people to discuss the site.

If you are in the education industry I strongly encourage you to bring up this concept at your next staff or board meeting. If you are worried about getting pushback, email me (info @ educationfreedom.org) and I can come talk to your organization and I’m not worried about getting pushback.

Sharing this idea is important because unlike most other resources, not only are ideas infinite, they are also exponential. This means that the more people that know about this idea, the more people that share this idea and improve it, which causes more people to know about the idea and so forth in a recursive loop.

So tet’s get more people talking about this idea so we can open the gates of education and allow more students to get a better, higher quality education.
